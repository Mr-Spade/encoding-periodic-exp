# Time Series Encoding with Frequency Domain Representation

This repository contains the experimental implementation for our research paper on time series encoding techniques utilizing frequency domain representations.

## Environment Setup

- Verified compatibility with Python 3.10.6, though other versions may be compatible
- All dependencies are specified in `requirements.txt`

## Reproduction Guidelines

To reproduce our experimental results:

1. Create an `origin/` directory in the project root
2. Download the benchmark datasets from the links provided in our paper and place them in the `origin/` directory
3. Execute the Python scripts sequentially as numbered in the repository
4. Upon completion, the experimental results will be generated
